# pcap_parser

## Description
This script came from a need to quickly analzye PCAP files for total packets, total packets from a specific source, retransmissions count.

If multiple files are provided they will be diffed to show packet loss between the two capture points.

## Example 

This example is a ftp-data flow so data is sent from the server to the client.

```bash
$ python pcap_parser.py 1.1.1.1 sgi/9252017_Test#1_FTP_Server_13-58-24-CT.pcap sgi/9252017_Test#1_FTP_SGi_13-58-24-CT.pcapng
